PROJECT NAME:
AssetTrack Pro

1. Understanding of Client Requirements

The client wants a software system that allows the company to track company-owned assets and monitor which asset is assigned to which employee.

The system should:
- Maintain records of all company assets.
- Maintain employee records.
- Track asset assignment history.
- Help the company know the current status and location of each asset.

The goal is to prevent asset misplacement, improve accountability, and maintain proper records.
